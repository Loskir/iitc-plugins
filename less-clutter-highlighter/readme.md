# Less clutter highlighter

### [Install](https://github.com/Loskir/iitc-plugins/raw/master/less-clutter-highlighter/less-clutter-highlighter.user.js)

Provides a highlighter that makes all portals render as smaller solid circles.

Not very useful as it can't be mixed with other highlighters, but still.
