# My collection of [IITC](https://iitc.app) plugins.

### List:
- [Draw tools: Replace portal](./dt-replace-portal) - Easily move all the links you drew from one portal to another. Great for creating plans.
- [Multi draw](./multi-draw) - Easily draw nested fields.
- [Lockdown changes](./lockdown-changes) - A tweak that sets default cooldown to 90s and default hacks count to 16.
- [Less clutter highlighter](./less-clutter-highlighter) - Provides a highlighter that makes all portals render as smaller solid circles.
